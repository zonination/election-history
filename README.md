## About ###

Inspired by [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/3pxna7/100_years_of_us_presidential_elections_a_table_of/).

Wanted to expand on it with the following improvements:

* including shading for margin of victory (% of winning party - % of next highest party)
* expanding the dataset to the earliest possible election data
* breaking down the states into regions, since there are clear election patterns
